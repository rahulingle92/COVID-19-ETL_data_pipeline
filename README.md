# Tiger-Analytics-ETL-Pipeline-Project
An automated data pipeline for Covid19 Prediction and Reporting
Building a reliable data pipeline to compile COVID-19 data from several sources, including government health departments, hospitals, and research institutes, would be the project's primary goal. These pipelines can clean, process, and integrate data into a centralized data lake or data warehouse, allowing it to be accessible for additional analysis, using the connections and transformations offered by Azure Data Factory.
