# Tiger-Analytics-ETL-Pipeline-Project
## An automated data pipeline for Covid19 Prediction and Reporting

### Goal of the Project
Building a reliable data pipeline to compile COVID-19 data from several sources, including government health departments, hospitals, and research institutes, would be the project's primary goal. These pipelines can clean, process, and integrate data into a centralized data lake or data warehouse, allowing it to be accessible for additional analysis, using the connections and transformations offered by Azure Data Factory.

### The Datasets' source
In this project, The dataset is ingested to Azure Data Factory from two sources: first dataset is ingested from Azure Blob storage and other dataset is ingested from http i.e website of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
